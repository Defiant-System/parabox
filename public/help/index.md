### How to
Sokoban is a classic puzzle game invented in Japan. The original game was written by 
Hiroyuki Imabayashi in. In 1980 it won a computer game contest. Mr Hiroyuki Imabayashi 
is president of the company Thinking Rabbit Inc. in Japan. Over the years many versions 
for all platforms have been made and new levels are created all the time.

Sokoban means warehouse keeper in Japanese. The object of the game is to push boxes 
(or balls) into their correct position in a crowded warehouse with a minimal number 
of pushes and moves. The boxes can only be pushed, never pulled. In original game, 
only one box can be pushed at a time - in this version, mutiple boxes are allowed to be pushed.
It sounds easy, but the levels range from very easy to extremely difficult, 
some takes hours and even days to figure out. The simplicity and elegance of the rules have 
made Sokoban one of the most popular logic games.
